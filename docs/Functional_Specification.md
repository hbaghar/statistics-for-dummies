# Functional Specification

## **User 1**

The user should have limited to no training in coding, should not know how to program in R, Scala, Stata or Python. That being said, we expect this user to have basic knowledge of statistical methods, they should be able to understand when each statistical method is used for and the amount of data required in order to perform each test.

## **Use Case 1**

Use of the whole GUI, including both data visualization tools and statistical inference and analysis.

## **User 2**

Any user that knows how to upload a file into a webpage and wants to understand their data set better by using our data snapshot and data visualization tools.

## **Use Case 2**

Use of only the data visualization part of the GUI. This includes the snapshot of the dataset where the user will obtain an understanding of the numerical and categorical columns in the data and how many null values are there in each column. The user will also be able to perform an array of plots and visualizations of features they select.
